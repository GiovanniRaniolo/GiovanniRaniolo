## Hi there 👋

I'm **Giovanni Raniolo**, a musicologist, music producer, DJ, and live electronic performer now transitioning into web development.

### About Me

- 👀 I’m interested in web development, music production, and exploring innovative technologies like blockchain and NFTs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack web development with a focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design through Edgemony.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, especially those that integrate creative and technical aspects, as well as music-related tech projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovanni-raniolo) or email at giovanni.raniolo@example.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I created my first program on a Commodore 64 when I was just 9 years old, and my love for technology has only grown since then!

### Projects

Here are a few projects I've been working on recently:

1. **Static HTML & CSS Site**: My first foray into web development, a simple static site with minimal CSS.
2. **CSS Deep Dive**: A project focusing on the box model, responsive design, and dynamic proportions using units like em, rem, and media queries.
3. **JavaScript To-Do List**: A fun project with filters, categories, and other typical to-do list features, developed with my team under the guidance of @Emanuele Guerini.
