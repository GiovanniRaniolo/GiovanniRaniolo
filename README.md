👋 Hi, I’m @GiovanniRaniolo
👀 I’m interested in web development, music production, and exploring innovative technologies like blockchain and NFTs.
🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack web development with a focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design through Edgemony.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, especially those that integrate creative and technical aspects, as well as music-related tech projects.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via LinkedIn or email at giovanni.raniolo@example.com.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I created my first program on a Commodore 64 when I was just 9 years old, and my love for technology has only grown since then!
